# Description
Creating trivia questions can be a time consuming process. Manually creating multiple choice questions involves choosing a topic, thinking of aspects of that topic, turning those aspects into question/correct answer pairs, and generating false answers to the question. An automated program could use the knowledge graph of Wikidata to automate any of these steps. We intend to create a system that takes a topic from the user and generates questions relevant to the topic.
